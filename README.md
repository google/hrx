# Human Readable Archive (.hrx)

This is a specification for a plain-text, human-friendly format for defining
multiple virtual text files in a single physical file, for situations when
creating many physical files is undesirable, such as defining test cases for a
text format.

Here's a sample HRX that contains two files:

```hrx
<===> input.scss
ul {
  margin-left: 1em;
  li {
    list-style-type: none;
  }
}

<===> output.css
ul {
  margin-left: 1em;
}
ul li {
  list-style-type: none;
}
```

HRX files are always encoded in UTF-8.

## Goals

The HRX format is intended to make it easy to:

* represent multiple chunks of plain-text data in a single physical file;
* read, edit, and create by humans with simple text editors;
* read and modify programatically, while generating easy-to-understand diffs for
  version control;
* integrate well with tooling for syntax-highlighting or providing other
  language-specific support for individual files it contains.

### Non-Goals

The HRX format is not intended as a wire format. The [multipart/mixed][] format
defined by MIME is already well-suited to that need.

[multipart/mixed]: https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc1341/7_2_Multipart.html

The HRX format is not intended to faithfully represent any arbitrary directory
structure. In order to ensure simplicity and human-readability, it intentionally
lacks support for binary data or complex permissions.

## Syntax

The syntax for a HRX file is as follows:

<x><pre>
**archive**        ::= **entry*** **comment**?
&#32;
**entry**          ::= **comment**? (**file** | **directory**)
**comment**        ::= **boundary** **newline** **body**
**file**           ::= **boundary** " "+ **path** **newline** **body**?
**directory**      ::= **boundary** " "+ **path** "/" **newline**+
**boundary**       ::= "<" "="+ ">" // must exactly match the first boundary in the **archive**
**newline**        ::= U+000A LINE FEED
**body**           ::= **contents** **newline** // no newline at the end of the **archive** (if the
&#32;                                           // **archive** ends in a **body**, all trailing
&#32;                                           // newlines are part of that **body**'s contents)
**contents**       ::= any sequence of characters that neither begins with **boundary** nor
&#32;                  includes U+000A LINE FEED followed immediately by **boundary**
&#32;
**path**           ::= **path-component** ("/" **path-component**)*
**path-component** ::= **path-character**+ // not equal to "." or ".."
**path-character** ::= any character other than U+0000 through U+001F, U+007F DELETE, U+002F 
&#32;                  SOLIDUS, U+003A COLON, or U+005C REVERSE SOLIDUS
</pre></x>

Each `path` in the file must be codepoint-for-codepoint unique. It's invalid for
an initial subsequence of a path's components to be the same as another `file`'s
path.

> The length of a `boundary` must be consistent throughout a given HRX file.
> Longer or shorter `boundary`s may be included in `content` blocks, which means
> a boundary may be chosen for the HRX file that will allow its `content` blocks
> to contain arbitrary text.
>
> `content` blocks don't contain the trailing newline in `body`. However, the
> last `body` in the file doesn't have a trailing newline, so if the file ends
> with a newline it *is* included in its `content` block.
>
> Directories are distinguished from empty files by the trailing "/" in the path
> name.

## Semantics

A HRX file, represented as an `archive`, contains a sequence of files and/or
directories, each represented as an `entry`. Each entry has an optional
`comment` that's intended to allow an archive author to include documentation or
notes relating to that entry. This comment may contain user-defined metadata
that applies to the following file.

Each entry has a `path` which represents the relative path from the root of the
archive to that entry. Each `path` is divided by U+002F SOLIDUS characters into
separate path components. Each component except for the last one represents a
nested series of directories; the last component represents the entry itself,
which is either a file (for a `file`) or a directory (for a `directory`). Parent
directories are implicitly assumed to exist if they have entries beneath them,
even if they aren't explicitly written as `directory`s.

Each path component is a string that represents the name of that component. Path
component names are interpreted exactly as they appear in the archive file.

File entries with an associated `body` have their contents given by the `body`'s
`contents` block. File entries with no `body` have empty contents.

### Extracting

Although HRX files are primarily intended to be used as a replacement for
multiple physical files, they can be extracted to the physical filesystem. When
a HRX file is extracted, the extraction process should (by default) create a
directory named after the HRX file, with the extension `".hrx"` removed.

The permissions of extracted files should match those of the original HRX file.
